Using the GeoJSON API:
In this program you will use a GeoLocation lookup API modelled after the Google API to look up some universities and parse the returned data.

Extracting Data from JSON:
The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
